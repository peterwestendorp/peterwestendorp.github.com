<h1>3D CSS talks</h1>

<p>Since I’ve been using 3D CSS quite a lot on <a href="http://www.foldable.me" target="_blank">Foldable.me</a>, I figured I should perhaps share some of my experiences by giving a presentation about it.</p>

<p>So my first ever conference talk was in October 2012 at <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/london-2012/" target="_blank">FOWA in London</a>. After my talk I sat down with Martha from <a href="http://www.awwwards.com" target="_blank">Awwwards</a> who wanted to interview me about the technology behind <a href="http://www.foldable.me" target="_blank">Foldable.me</a>. You can find the interview on the <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/peter-westendorp-talks-to-us-about-foldable-me.html" target="_blank">Awwwards blog</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly there was no video of my talk at FOWA publicly available, so there was only one thing I could do… So in January 2013 I went off to <a href="http://takeoffconf.com/" target="_blank">TakeOff Conf</a> in Lille to give another talk about 3D CSS. This one was recorded and published for free, so here it is:</p>
