<h1>F*rk jQuery! Introducing ukQuery...</h1>
<p><time datetime="Mon May 23 00:00:00 +0100 2011">23 May 2011</time></p>
<p>Since a few weeks I have broadened my horizon by learning more about jQuery and its famous jQuery object. As a developer who used to work with Dojo a lot, I found a few things that were a bit confusing to me.</p>

<h2 id='making_jquery_better__ukquery'>Making jQuery better - ukQuery</h2>

<p>To make it easier to work with jQuery, I decided to fork jQuery and create <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/peterwestendorp/jquery'>my own custom version</a>. I started with an important spelling correction; colour is now spelled in UK English. So every styling on the CSS &#8216;color&#8217; property via ukQuery can be done with the &#8216;colour&#8217; property as well.</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  $("a").css("colour", "red");
</pre>
<p>To make the UK jQuery experience complete, you can only use the &#8216;colour&#8217; property after calling the excuseMe() function. So remember your manners:</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  $("a").excuseMe().css("colour", "red");
</pre>
<p>Having made these changes, the $ symbol looks really silly and because £ is an invalid character in Javascript, I replaced the $ character by GBP. The result is a really great tool, which gives jQuery a more natural feeling for UK based developers.</p>

<p>So now I’ve had a rant, I’d like to share some other thoughts on jQuery&#8230;</p>

<h2 id='jquery_object_versus_normal_nodelist'>jQuery object versus normal nodelist</h2>

<p>Querying the DOM with jQuery returns a jQuery object with a nodelist in it. If you want for example to change the CSS of all the nodes, you can simply do this:</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  $(".foo").css("display", "none");
</pre>
<p>I see the advantages of jQuery&#8217;s approach here; first of all you don&#8217;t have do deal with nodelists or array&#8217;s if you don&#8217;t understand them. Besides that, it&#8217;s shorter and more readable. At least in some cases&#8230;</p>

<p>What if you want to add some extra text to the innerHTML of a bunch of nodes and then change some styles?</p>

<p>You will end up with something like this:</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  var foos = $(".foo");
  $.each(foos, function(index, myFoo){
    myFoo.innerHTML += " world!";
    $(myFoo).css("color", "red");
  });
</pre>
<p>What confuses me here is that you have to extract the node from the jQuery object so that you can use innerHTML:</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  $.each(foos, function(index, myFoo){
    myFoo.innerHTML += " world!";
</pre>
<p>After that you have to put it back into a jQuery object again, just to be able to use methods, such as .css(), on that node:</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  $(myFoo).css("color", "red");
</pre>
<p>To be fair, I could also just call jQuery&#8217;s .append() in my jQuery object (although I thought &#8220;append&#8221; in Javascript had something to do with inserting nodes into the DOM). My point is this; Why is jQuery forcing me to either always use all of its magic, or fool around with extracting nodes from objects? I think that if you start extracting nodes from a jQuery object and wrapping it back in a new one again, the readability of your code decreases. (James Padolsey wrote an <a href='http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/76-bytes-for-faster-jquery'>interesting article</a>, as well as a plugin, related to this topic). So why not just $.css(myFoo) instead of $(myFoo).css(). Why all the bling?</p>

<p>Dojo and MooTools (and probably a lot more frameworks) for example, don&#8217;t require you to wrap a node in some magic object, but still enable you to chain your actions.</p>

<h2 id='what_is_this'>What is this?</h2>

<p>In Javascript the this keyword refers to its owner <a target='_blank' href='http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html'>PPK's Quirksmode</a> provides a lot of useful information about this). So if you write a simple function:</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  function foo(){
   console.log(this); //will output window
  }
</pre>
<p>This will output the window object in the console. Because that function is &#8220;owned&#8221; by the window object. If we use the same function and place it in a property of the &#8220;foo&#8221; object, the this keyword will refer to the &#8220;foo&#8221; object:</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  var foo = {};
  foo.myMethod = function(){
   console.log(this); //will output foo
  };
  foo.myMethod();
</pre>
<p>In Javascript there is one exception to this behaviour; in the case of an eventlistener, this will refer to to node where the event was fired from:</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  bar.addEventListener('click',function(){
   console.log(this); //will output bar
  },false);
</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much how the this keyword behaves in Javascript. It always refers to it&#8217;s owner object, except in the case of an eventlistener&#8230;</p>

<p>jQuery however makes it a bit more complicated.</p>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
  var foo = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
  $.each(foo, function(){
   console.log(this); //will output apple, then orange, and
   //finally banana
  });
</pre>
<p>In a jQuery.each loop, this refers to the current element. So that&#8217;s another exception in the behaviour of this. Yet, another confusing aspect. I thought a Javascript framework was meant to make things more consistent, to normalize them! For me, it is making this worse.</p>

<h2 id='its_not_only_complaining'>It&#8217;s not only complaining</h2>

<p>There are obviously a lot of good parts of jQuery. All the magic from the jQuery object makes it easy to work with for beginners. And if you&#8217;re a more advanced user, you can definitely also use jQuery for the more nifty scripts. Besides that, jQuery has a huge active community that have together created a lot of great plugins and documentation, which can save you a lot of time&#8230;</p>

<p>Have you too wrestled with jQuery? Let me know your thoughts! If you would like to know anymore about the aspects of jQuery I have discussed here; there is also a nice <a target='_blank' href='http://vimeo.com/8247540'>episode of the yayQuery podcast</a> on this topic.</p>
